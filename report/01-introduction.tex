\chapter{Introduction}

We use the \emph{natbib} packages for citations.  We therefore use the
command \texttt{citep} to get a reference in parenthesis, like this
\parencite{heisenberg2015}.  It is also possible to include the author as part
of the sentence using \texttt{citet}, like talking about the work of
\textcite{einstein2016}.

  For your paper to be published in the conference proceedings, you must use this document as both an instruction set and as a template into which you can type your own text. If your paper does not conform to the required format, you will be asked to fix it.

  Please do not reuse your past papers as a template. To prepare your paper for submission, please always download a fresh copy of this template from the conference website and please read the format instructions in this template before you use it for your paper.

  Conversion to PDF may cause problems in the resulting PDF or expose problems in your source document. Before submitting your final paper in PDF, check that the format in your paper PDF conforms to this template. Specifically, check the appearance of the title and author block, the appearance of section headings, document margins, column width, column spacing, and other features such as figure numbers, table numbers and equation number. In summary, you must proofread your final paper in PDF before submission.

This work seeks to find speaker-invariant speech features which can be used to discriminate between different linguistic units in a robust manner.
We focus in particular on simpler, interpretable models that improve on features inferred from unlabelled data, thus also making use of the full set of unlabelled data, in addition to speech fragment information.
The goal is for the model to noticably improve on the input features, as well as to achieve competitive results in the context of the first track of the Zero Resource Speech Challenge.
